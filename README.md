# Little Ming

a discord bot for people wanting to try out a new name

This bot will send you a short DM every few hours with a wholesome message using one of your chosen names, selected randomly from a list.

## Commands

- `~help`: Get this list.
- `~addname [name]`: Add `name` to your list of chosen names.
- `~removename [name]`: Remove `name` from your list of chosen names.
- `~listnames`: Get a list of all your chosen names.
- `~start`: Start sending you messages.
- `~stop`: Stop sending you messages.
- `~frequency [duration]`: Set the average frequency of the message to `duration`. Messages will be sent within a quarter of that time period (so if you set this to 2 hours, the time between messages will be between 1.5 hours and 2.5 hours.)
- `~whatfrequency`: Get the frequency of the message.

## Getting the bot

To add this bot to your server go to:
> https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=649727898248544267&scope=bot&permissions=2048

It doesn't do anything on the server, but I can't figure out how to start a DM directly with a bot... So just add it to your server and DM it from there. (If someone knows how plz tell me!)
